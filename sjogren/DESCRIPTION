Description: This package is designed to assist in the single-cell analysis of cells in Sjögrens disease, with an emphasis on autoreactive B lymphocytes. It can, however, be used for any celltype, as its clonotyping and assignment functions can be adapted to T lymphocytes as well. It also assists in processing multiple Seurat objects at once.
